It is also is biggest\\nbenefit, purifycss can work with any files, not just html or javascript. But\\npurifycss works by looking at all the words in the files and comparing them with\\nthe selectors in the css. Every words is consider a selector, which means that a\\nlot of selectors can be consider used because you have the selector name in a\\nparagraph or somewhere in your files.</p>\\n<p>Purgecss fixes this problem by providing the possibility to create an\\n<em>extractor</em>, an extractor is a function that takes the content of a file and\\nextract the list of css selectors in it. It allows a perfect removal of unused\\ncss. The extractor can used a parser that returns an ast and then looks through\\nit to select the css selectors. That is the way <code>purge-from-html</code> works. You can\\nspecified which selectors you want to use for each types of files, and so, get\\nthe most accurate results. You can still use the default or the legacy extractor\\nthat will act the same way as purifycss.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"uncss\\\"><a href=\\\"#uncss\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Uncss</h2>\\n<p>As indicated in its Readme, Uncss works the following way:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The HTML files are loaded by jsdom and JavaScript is executed.</li>\\n<li>All the stylesheets are parsed by PostCSS.</li>\\n<li>document.querySelector filters out selectors that are not found in the HTML\\nfiles.</li>\\n<li>The remaining rules are converted back to CSS.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Because of the emulation of html, and the execution of javascript, uncss is\\neffective at removing unused selectors from web application.

To remove unused css from pug template files, you will\\nneed to convert pug to html and then emulate the page inside jsdom and uncss\\nwill run <code>document.querySelector</code> on each selectors and step 4.</p>\\n<p>Uncss by its design is probably the most accurate tool to remove css out of a web\\napplication at this moment if you do not use server side rendering.</p>\\n<p>Purgecss does not have an extractor right now for javascript files.

<code>npm i</code> to fetch its dependencies.\\nThen, you can run several commands:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>npm run dev</code> will build cjs and es module of Purgecss in the <code>lib</code> folder and watch for changes.</li>\\n<li><code>npm run lint</code> checks the code style.</li>\\n<li><code>npm test</code> runs the complete test suite.</li>\\n<li><code>npm test -- --watch</code> runs an interactive test watcher.</li>\\n<li><code>npm test &#x3C;pattern></code> runs tests with matching filenames.</li>\\n<li><code>npm run flow</code> runs the <a href=\\\"https://flowtype.org/\\\">Flow</a> typechecks.</li>\\n<li><code>npm run build</code> creates the cjs and es module of Purgecss in the <code>lib</code> folder.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Make sure that your pull request contains unit tests for any new functionality. This way we can ensure that we don’t break your code in the future.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"license\\\"><a href=\\\"#license\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>License</h3>\\n<p>This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the <a href=\\\"LICENSE\\\">LICENSE</a> file for details.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"aknowledgement\\\"><a href=\\\"#aknowledgement\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Aknowledgement</h3>\\n<p>This CONTRIBUTING.md is based on the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react\\\">react</a> <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute.md\\\">how-to-contribute.md</a> file.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"How to Contribute\",\"next\":null,\"prev\":null},\"fields\":{\"path\":\"docs/how-to-contribute.md\",\"slug\":\"purgecss/docs/how-to-contribute.html\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"purgecss/docs/how-to-contribute.html\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/purgecss-docs-how-to-contribute-html.json\n// module id = 238\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Javascript API\",\"next\":\"use-with-webpack.html\",\"prev\":\"cli.html\"},\"fields\":{\"path\":\"docs/javascript-api.md\",\"slug\":\"purgecss/docs/javascript-api.html\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"purgecss/docs/javascript-api.html\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/purgecss-docs-javascript-api-html.json\n// module id = 239\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Purgecss can be used with the provided cli or programmaticaly via the API.

If you are trying to attach custom data to a standard DOM element, consider using a custom data attribute as described <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes\\\">on MDN</a>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>React does not yet recognize the attribute you specified. This will likely be fixed in a future version of React. However, React currently strips all unknown attributes, so specifying them in your React app will not cause them to be rendered.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You are using a React component without an upper case. React interprets it as a DOM tag because <a href=\\\"/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#user-defined-components-must-be-capitalized\\\">React JSX transform uses the upper vs. lower case convention to distinguish between user-defined components and DOM tags</a>.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<hr>\\n<p>To fix this, composite components should “consume” any prop that is intended for the composite component and not intended for the child component. Example:</p>\\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong> Unexpected <code>layout</code> prop is forwarded to the <code>div</code> tag.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">MyDiv</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>layout <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">===</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'horizontal'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// BAD!

is React?</h3>\\n<p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>\\n<p>React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with

/></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We’ll get to the funny XML-like tags in a second. Your components tell React what you want to render – then React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.</p>\\n<p>Here, ShoppingList is a <strong>React component class</strong>, or <strong>React component type</strong>. A component takes in parameters, called <code>props</code>, and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the <code>render</code> method.</p>\\n<p>The <code>render</code> method returns a <em>description</em> of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen. In particular, <code>render</code> returns a <strong>React element</strong>, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called JSX which makes it easier to write these structures. The <code>&#x3C;div /></code> syntax is transformed at build time to <code>React.createElement('div')</code>. The example above is equivalent to:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">createElement</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'div'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>className<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'shopping-list'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">createElement</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'h1'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/* ... h1 children ... */</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">createElement</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'ul'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/* ... ul children ... */</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/repl/#?presets=react&code_lz=DwEwlgbgBAxgNgQwM5IHIILYFMC8AiJACwHsAHUsAOwHMBaOMJAFzwD4AoKKYQgRlYDKJclWpQAMoyZQAZsQBOUAN6l5ZJADpKmLAF9gAej4cuwAK5wTXbg1YBJSswTV5mQ7c7XgtgOqEETEgAguTuYFamtgDyMBZmSGFWhhYchuAQrEA\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">See full expanded version.</a></p>\\n<p>If you’re curious, <code>createElement()</code> is described in more detail in the <a href=\\\"/docs/react-api.html#createelement\\\">API reference</a>, but we won’t be using it directly in this tutorial. Instead, we will keep using JSX.</p>\\n<p>You can put any JavaScript expression within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a real JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around your program.</p>\\n<p>The <code>ShoppingList</code> component only renders built-in DOM components, but you can compose custom React components just as easily, by writing <code>&#x3C;ShoppingList /></code>. Each component is encapsulated so it can operate independently, which allows you to build complex UIs out of simple components.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"getting-started\\\"><a href=\\\"#getting-started\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Getting Started</h3>\\n<p>Start with this example: <a href=\\\"https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010\\\">Starter Code</a>.</p>\\n<p>It contains the shell of what we’re building today.

But right now, the state is encapsulated in each Square component. To make a fully-working game, we now need to check if one player has won the game, and alternate placing X and O in the squares. To check if someone has won, we’ll need to have the value of all 9 squares in one place, rather than split up across the Square components.</p>\\n<p>You might think that Board should just inquire what the current state of each Square is. Although it is technically possible to do this in React, it is discouraged because it tends to make code difficult to understand, more brittle, and harder to refactor.</p>\\n<p>Instead, the best solution here is to store this state in the Board component instead of in each Square – and the Board component can tell each Square what to display, like how we made each square display its index earlier.</p>\\n<p><strong>When you want to aggregate data from multiple children or to have two child components communicate with each other, move the state upwards so that it lives in the parent component. The parent can then pass the state back down to the children via props, so that the child components are always in sync with each other and with the parent.</strong></p>\\n<p>Pulling state upwards like this is common when refactoring React components, so let’s take this opportunity to try it out. Add a constructor to the Board and set its initial state to contain an array with 9 nulls, corresponding to the 9 squares:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre

Let’s make the following changes to Square:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Replace <code>this.state.value</code> with <code>this.props.value</code> in Square’s <code>render</code>.</li>\\n<li>Replace <code>this.setState()</code> with <code>this.props.onClick()</code> in Square’s <code>render</code>.</li>\\n<li>Delete <code>constructor</code> definition from Square because it doesn’t have state anymore.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After these changes, the whole Square component looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Square</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\\">  <span class=\\\"token function\\\">render</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n</span>    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n<span class=\\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\\">      <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">className</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>square<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">onClick</span><span class=\\\"token script language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">onClick</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\\">        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>value<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span>      <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Now when the square is clicked, it calls the <code>onClick</code> function that was passed by Board. Let’s recap what happens here:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The <code>onClick</code> prop on the built-in DOM <code>&#x3C;button></code> component tells React to set up a click event listener.</li>\\n<li>When the button is clicked, React will call the <code>onClick</code> event handler defined in Square’s <code>render()</code> method.</li>\\n<li>This event handler calls <code>this.props.onClick()</code>. Square’s props were specified by the Board.</li>\\n<li>Board passed <code>onClick={() => this.handleClick(i)}</code> to Square, so, when called, it runs <code>this.handleClick(i)</code> on the Board.</li>\\n<li>We have not defined the <code>handleClick()</code> method on the Board yet, so the code crashes.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Note that DOM <code>&#x3C;button></code> element’s <code>onClick</code> attribute has a special meaning to React, but we could have named Square’s <code>onClick</code> prop or Board’s <code>handleClick</code> method differently. It is, however, conventional in React apps to use <code>on*</code> names for the attributes and <code>handle*</code> for the handler methods.</p>\\n<p>Try clicking a square – you should get an error because we haven’t defined <code>handleClick</code> yet. Add it to the Board class.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"token

Let’s talk about what this means and why it is an important concept to learn.</p>\\n<p>There are generally two ways for changing data. The first method is to <em>mutate</em> the data by directly changing the values of a variable. The second method is to replace the data with a new copy of the object that also includes desired changes.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"data-change-with-mutation\\\"><a href=\\\"#data-change-with-mutation\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Data change with mutation</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> player <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>score<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Jeff'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nplayer<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>score <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Now player is {score: 2, name: 'Jeff'}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h4 id=\\\"data-change-without-mutation\\\"><a href=\\\"#data-change-without-mutation\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Data change without mutation</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> player <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>score<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Jeff'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> newPlayer <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> Object<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">assign</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> player<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>score<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Now player is unchanged, but newPlayer is {score: 2, name: 'Jeff'}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Or if you are using object spread syntax proposal, you can write:</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// var newPlayer = {...player, score: 2};</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The end result is the same but by not mutating (or changing the underlying data) directly we now have an added benefit that can help us increase component and overall application performance.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"easier-undoredo-and-time-travel\\\"><a href=\\\"#easier-undoredo-and-time-travel\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Easier Undo/Redo and Time Travel</h4>\\n<p>Immutability also makes some complex features much easier to implement.

This then requires comparing the current object to a previous copy, traversing the entire object tree, and comparing each variable and value. This process can become increasingly complex.</p>\\n<p>Determining how an immutable object has changed is considerably easier. If the object being referenced is different from before, then the object has changed.

Rather than define a class extending <code>React.Component</code>, simply write a function that takes props and returns what should be rendered.</p>\\n<p>Replace the whole Square class with this function:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">Square</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">className</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>square<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">onClick</span><span class=\\\"token script language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>onClick<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>value<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You’ll need to change <code>this.props</code> to <code>props</code> both times it appears. Many components in your apps will be able to be written as functional components: these components tend to be easier to write and React will optimize them more in the future.</p>\\n<p>While we’re cleaning up the code, we also changed <code>onClick={() => props.onClick()}</code> to just <code>onClick={props.onClick}</code>, as passing the function down is enough for our example. Note that <code>onClick={props.onClick()}</code> would not work because it would call <code>props.onClick</code> immediately instead of passing it down.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/QvvJOv?editors=0010\\\">View the current code.</a></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"taking-turns\\\"><a href=\\\"#taking-turns\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Taking Turns</h3>\\n<p>An obvious defect in our game is that only X can play.

We’re already creating a new <code>squares</code> array each time a move is made, which means we can easily store the past board states simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>Let’s plan to store an object like this in state:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code>history <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    squares<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    squares<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'X'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// ...</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We’ll want the top-level Game component to be responsible for displaying the list of moves. So just as we pulled the state up before from Square into Board, let’s now pull it up again from Board into Game – so that we have all the information we need at the top level.</p>\\n<p>First, set up

<code>squares</code> via props and has its own <code>onClick</code> prop specified by Game, like the transformation we made for Square earlier. You can pass the location of each square into the click handler so that we still know which square was clicked. Here is a list of steps you need to do:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Delete the <code>constructor</code> in Board.</li>\\n<li>Replace <code>this.state.squares[i]</code> with <code>this.props.squares[i]</code> in

If you render a component that has state, that state needs to be stored – and regardless of how you implement your components, React stores a reference to the backing native views.</p>\\n<p>When you update that list, React needs to determine what has changed. You could’ve added, removed, rearranged, or updated items in the list.</p>\\n<p>Imagine transitioning from</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-html\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Alexa: 7 tasks left<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Ben: 5 tasks left<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-html\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Ben: 9 tasks left<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Claudia: 8 tasks left<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Alexa: 5 tasks left<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>To a human eye, it looks likely that Alexa and Ben swapped places and Claudia was added – but React is just a computer program and doesn’t know what you intended it to do. As a result, React asks you to specify a <em>key</em> property on each element in a list, a string to differentiate each component from its siblings. In this case, <code>alexa</code>, <code>ben</code>, <code>claudia</code> might be sensible keys; if the items correspond to objects in a database, the database ID is usually a good choice:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-html\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>li</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">key</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>{user.id}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>{user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p><code>key</code> is a special property that’s reserved by React (along with <code>ref</code>, a more advanced feature). When an element is created, React pulls off the <code>key</code> property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though it may look like it is part of props, it cannot be referenced with <code>this.props.key</code>. React uses the key automatically while deciding which children to update; there is no way for a component to inquire about its own key.</p>\\n<p>When a list is rerendered, React takes each element in the new version and looks for one with a matching key in the previous list. When a key is added to the set, a component is created; when a key is removed, a component is destroyed. Keys tell React about the identity of each component, so that it can maintain the state across rerenders. If you change the key of a component, it will be completely destroyed and recreated with a new state.</p>\\n<p><strong>It’s strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists.</strong> If you don’t have an appropriate key handy, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do.</p>\\n<p>If you don’t specify any key, React will warn you and fall back to using the array index as a key – which is not the correct choice if you ever reorder elements in the list or add/remove items anywhere but the bottom of the list. Explicitly passing <code>key={i}</code> silences the warning but has the same problem so isn’t recommended in most cases.</p>\\n<p>Component keys don’t need to be globally unique, only unique relative to the immediate siblings.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"implementing-time-travel\\\"><a href=\\\"#implementing-time-travel\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Implementing Time Travel</h3>\\n<p>For our move list, we already have a unique ID for each step: the number of the move when it happened.

You will find the component definition responsible for the PropTypes direct call. Most likely, the issue is due to third-party PropTypes that wrap React’s PropTypes, for example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code>Button<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>propTypes <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  highlighted<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> ThirdPartyPropTypes<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">deprecated</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n    PropTypes<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>bool<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Use `active` prop instead'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In this case, <code>ThirdPartyPropTypes.deprecated</code> is a wrapper calling <code>PropTypes.bool</code>. This pattern by itself is fine, but triggers a false positive because React thinks you are calling PropTypes directly.
