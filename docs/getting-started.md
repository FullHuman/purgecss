# Getting Started

Most bundlers and frameworks to build websites are using PostCSS. The easiest way to configure PurgeCSS is with its PostCSS plugin.

Install the PostCSS plugin:

:::: code-tabs
@tab npm
```sh
npm i -D @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
```
@tab yarn
```sh
yarn add @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss --dev
```
::::

and add the PurgeCSS plugin to the PostCSS configuration:

```js{1,5-7}
import { purgeCSSPlugin } from '@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss';

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    purgecss({
      content: ['./**/*.html']
    })
  ]
}
```

PurgeCSS will remove the CSS that is not in the files specified in the `content` option.

You can find more information about PostCSS plugin and the configuration options on the following pages:
