If you aren’t doing anything (fancy) with refs, there is a good chance that the problem is not with your refs, but rather an issue with having multiple copies of React loaded into your project. Sometimes, when you pull in a third-party module via npm, you will get a duplicate copy of the dependency library, and this can create problems.</p>\n<p>If you are using npm… <code>npm ls</code> or <code>npm ls react</code> might help illuminate.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Refs Must Have Owner Warning",next:null,prev:null},fields:{path:"warnings/refs-must-have-owner.md",slug:"warnings/refs-must-have-owner.html"}}},pathContext:{slug:"warnings/refs-must-have-owner.html"}}}});
