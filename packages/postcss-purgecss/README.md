[PostCSS] plugin for PurgeCSS.

[PostCSS]: https://github.com/postcss/postcss

## Installation

```
npm i -D @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
```

## Usage

```js
const purgecss = require('@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss')
postcss([
  purgecss({
    content: ['./src/**/*.html']
  })
])
```

See [PostCSS] docs for examples for your environment.

## Options

All of the options of purgecss are available to use with the plugins.
You will find below the main options available. For the complete list, go to the [purgecss documentation website](https://www.purgecss.com/configuration.html#options).

### `content` (**required** or use `contentFunction` instead)
Type: `Array<string>`

You can specify content that should be analyzed by Purgecss with an array of filenames or globs. The files can be HTML, Pug, Blade, etc.

### `contentFunction` (as alternative to `content`)
Type: `(sourceInputFile: string) => Array<string>`

The function receives the current source input file. With this you may provide a specific array of globs for each input. E.g. for
an angular application only scan the components template counterpart for every component scss file:

```js
purgecss({
  contentFunction: (source: string) => {
    (/component\.scss$/.test(source))
      ? [sourceInputFile.replace(/scss$/, 'html')]
      : ['./src/**/*.html']
  },
})
```

### `extractors`
Type: `Array<Object>`

Purgecss can be adapted to suit your needs. If you notice a lot of unused CSS is not being removed, you might want to use a custom extractor.
More information about extractors [here](https://www.purgecss.com/extractors.html).

### `whitelist`
Type: `Array<string>`

You can whitelist selectors to stop Purgecss from removing them from your CSS. This can be accomplished with the options whitelist and whitelistPatterns.

### `whitelistPatterns`
Type: `Array<RegExp>`

You can whitelist selectors based on a regular expression with whitelistPatterns.

### `rejected`
Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

### `registerDependencies`
Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

If true, all files that are found by content globs or returned from content function will be registered as dependencies for webpack through PostCSS messages.
More information and examples [here](https://purgecss.com/configuration.html#options).


If true, purged selectors will be captured and rendered as PostCSS messages.
Use with a PostCSS reporter plugin like [`postcss-reporter`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-reporter)
to print the purged selectors to the console as they are processed.

### `keyframes`
Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

If you are using a CSS animation library such as animate.css, you can remove unused keyframes by setting the keyframes option to true.

#### `fontFace`
Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

If there are any unused @font-face rules in your css, you can remove them by setting the fontFace option to true.
